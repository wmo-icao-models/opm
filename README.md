OPM - The 'Observable Property Model' provides a framework for qualifying or constraining physical properties. For example, the model 
enables a standard physical property such as "air temperature" to be qualified as "daily maximum air temperature" by specifying an 
aggregation period of 24-hours using the "maximum" statistical function. This model is derived from work undertaken in the OGC Sensor Web
Enablement SWG.

As an interim measure, the WMO Logical Data Model METCE includes the Observable Property Model. Further discussions on the governance 
arrangements of this model are pending.
